# abs_highest_freq-lowest_freq_ele_in_Arr

given an array of n numbers,print the absolute difference between the integer with highest frequency and the element with lowest non-zero frequency.if more than one answers are possible, print the biggest possible answer.
contraints :
1<= n <=10^3
0<= a[i] <=100
input :
5
1 2 1 4 5
output :
4
explanation :
element with highest frequency is 1
element with lowest frequency is 2,4,5
but the max possible diff is abs(1-5)=4
